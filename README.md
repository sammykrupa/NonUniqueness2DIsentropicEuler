Included here is the MATLAB code associated with the paper "Contact discontinuities for 2-D isentropic Euler are unique in 1-D but wildly non-unique otherwise" by Sam G. Krupa and László Székelyhidi Jr.

There are two files:

IsentropicEuler2DContactDiscontinuity.m -- This file includes the code to do a numerical search for fan subsolution corresponding to a contact discontinuity. Also included in the code are the exact symbolic values used in our paper, as well the code to symbolically verify that these symbolic values verify all required conditions.

IsentropicEuler2DRandomRiemannData.m -- This file contains the code to do a trial of numerical searches for subsolution fans corresponding to randomly chosen Riemann initial data.
